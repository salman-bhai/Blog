Hie,

Just created my blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - the fast and minimilastic website generator. It's really easy to implement and I really liked it. So, I'm dedicating my first blog to it.

One of my friend suggested me about Jekyll when I told him about my plan to create a blog. Then I searched the web about it and started creating my blog. And in just few hours, my blog was ready!

For those who are wondering how I created the blog, following are the links for reference :
