### Introduction

Just created my blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - the fast and minimilastic website generator. It's really easy to create 

One of my friend suggested me about Jekyll when I told him about my plan to create a blog. Then I searched the web about it and started creating my blog. And in just few hours, my blog was ready!

A typical post using Jekyll would look something like this.

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
